2	Public domain software
A number of code elements are public domain software:
*	libjpeg
libjpeg is used within Twonky to resize JPEG images, for example to extract thumbnails or to make images 
fit to specific DLNA profiles.
License may be found at http://www.ijg.org/files/README 
Independent JPEG Group's free JPEG software 
------------------------------------------- 
 
This package contains C software to implement JPEG image encoding, decoding, 
and transcoding.  JPEG is a standardized compression method for full-color 
and gray-scale images. 
 
The distributed programs provide conversion between JPEG "JFIF" format and 
image files in PBMPLUS PPM/PGM, GIF, BMP, and Targa file formats.  The 
core compression and decompression library can easily be reused in other 
programs, such as image viewers.  The package is highly portable C code; 
we have tested it on many machines ranging from PCs to Crays. 
 
We are releasing this software for both noncommercial and commercial use. 
Companies are welcome to use it as the basis for JPEG-related products. 
We do not ask a royalty, although we do ask for an acknowledgement in 
product literature (see the README file in the distribution for details). 
We hope to make this software industrial-quality --- although, as with 
anything that's free, we offer no warranty and accept no liability. 
 
For more information, contact jpeg-info@jpegclub.org. 


*	libtomcrypt
libtomcrypt contains methods implementations for cryptographic algorithms and related functions. Twonky 
uses these methods for HTTPS and for cryptographic calculations during WMDRM and DTCP-IP related 
operations.

LibTomCrypt is public domain.  As should all quality software be.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, 
You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other 
liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You 
may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor,
